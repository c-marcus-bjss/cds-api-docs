# Getting Set Up


## Linking to GitHub

 1. Create a GitHub account and send your username/email to Colin/Charlie so they can add you as a collaborator.
 2. Navigate to [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) 
 3. In the sidebar click 'Workspaces' and then 'Add a GitHub workspace'
 4. Use Settings:
 
|Repository URL|Branch|
|--|--|
| https://github.com/cmarcus-nhs/cds-api-docs |`develop`  |

 5. Click OK and Allow GitHub to authorise.
 
 ## Authoring and Reviewing

Pages are written in markup as per confluence. StackEdit navigation tutorials can be [here](https://github.com/cmarcus-nhs/cds-api-docs/blob/develop/docs/stackedit/Stackedit%20Tutorial.md)
Stackedit allows you to add inline comments which are stored as metadata. These are not visible in the rendered markdown, but do show up on StackEdit. 
An example is attached here.
The review process then works exactly like confluence, with the caveat that you cannot explicitly tag people.
