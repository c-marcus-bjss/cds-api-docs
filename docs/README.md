# Getting Set Up


## Linking to GitHub

 1. Create a GitHub account and send your username/email to Colin/Charlie so they can add you as a collaborator.
 2. Navigate to [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) 
 3. In the sidebar on the right, click 'Workspaces' and then 'Add a GitHub workspace
 4. Use Settings:
 
|Repository URL|Branch|
|--|--|
| https://github.com/cmarcus-nhs/cds-api-docs |`develop`  |

5. Click OK and Allow GitHub to authorise (no need to allow access to your private repositories).
 
 ## Authoring and Reviewing

Pages are written in markup as per confluence. StackEdit navigation tutorials can be [here](https://github.com/cmarcus-nhs/cds-api-docs/blob/develop/docs/stackedit/Stackedit%20Tutorial.md)
Stackedit allows you to add inline comments which are stored as metadata. These are not visible in the rendered markdown, but do show up on StackEdit. 
An example is attached here.
The review process then works exactly like confluence, with the caveat that you cannot explicitly tag people. 	  

## Publishing

When a version is ready to be published, a Pull Request can be created in GitHub [here](https://github.com/cmarcus-nhs/cds-api-docs/compare/master...develop). GitHub's full review process supports comments, email notifications, conversations, updates on the fly etc. After all the approvers have approved the version, it can be merged to the `master` branch, which is suitable for publishing.
